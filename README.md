# iOS Games - Lua
A collection of open-sourced iOS games and apps, written in Lua for Codea (https://codea.io)

Some of these are available on the app store, others are not. 
Some are also available as slightly different web games at (https://tarrouye.net/games).
For these, I will usually also provide the .pde Processing file since the codebases are separate. 

You may use the code within this repository in your own projects but please provide attribution.
